\section{Data Description}
% 
Several Dealerships has gather releveant and appropriate information, and organized a dataset concerning 9,861 sales invlolving a trade-in of truck at nine dealerships.  These data are contained in the file {\tt UsedTrucks.dat}, which is
available in the {\tt Data} folder.
Each Truck sale in the data set is a row, while the columns correspond 
to the variables whose names and definitions are the following:
\bigskip
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  \hline
    Variable & Definition \\
  \hline

    {\tt type}        &sale type \\ 
    {\tt pauc}       &price when sold at auction \\ 
    {\tt pret}      &price when sold retail \\ 
    {\tt mileage}    &odometer \\ 
    {\tt make}       &make of vehicule \\ 
    {\tt year}       &model year of vehicle \\ 
    {\tt damage}      &an index of damage to vehicle, 1 little damage, 10 a lot\\
    {\tt dealer}     &dealer id \\ 
    {\tt ror}    &rate-of-return \\ 
    {\tt ror}             &net amount given to trade-in \\ 
  \hline
\end{tabular}
%\caption{Summary of Numeric Variables}
%\label{tab:summary}
\end{table}

\bigskip
\noindent
I have downloaded the file {\tt UsedTrucks.dat}, 
loaded the data described above into 
\textsf{R}, 
calculated the summary statistics for these data, 
and finally, presented 
these statistics in \LaTeX\ tables.
These operations are all performed by the script 
{\tt UsedTrucks\_Tables.R} in the {\tt Code} folder. 
The script uses an \textsf{R} package called {\tt xtable} 
to automate the
production of the tables from a data frames in \textsf{R}.)

\medskip
\noindent
I analyze the data in subsets, according to Type , 
calculating the summary statistics for each subset and present these 
statistics in the \LaTeX\ tables that follow.
